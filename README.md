O'Reilly books are here to help you get your job done. In general, you may use the code in O'Reilly books in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you're reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from our books does not require permission. Answering a question by citing our books and quoting example code does not require permission. On the other hand, selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O'Reilly books does require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from our books into your product's documentation does require permission.
	  
We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN.
	  
If you think your use of code examples falls outside fair use or the permission given here, feel free to contact us at <permissions@oreilly.com>.
	  
Please note that the examples are not production code and have not been carefully tested. They are provided "as-is" and come with no warranty of any kind.

## Author's addendum

I created this repository after issues arose with the repo on O'Reilly's site. Please use it as the primary source of truth and for communication with me: questions, comments, and feedback always welcome.

One question that arises occasionally is where to find the scripts I used to create/configure the database container images for my examples. I documented the repo in early drafts, but at some point in the revision cycle, those references unfortunately disappeared. The scripts I used can be found [in the repo linked here](https://github.com/mkheck/containerscripts-database).

NOTE: You will need to edit the scripts to reflect your particular machine/directory structure(s), but these are the very same scripts I used on my MacBook Pro.

Thank you for choosing to share your time with me, and for always striving to improve.
